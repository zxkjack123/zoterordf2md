# zoterordf2md

This project, **ZoteroRDF2MD**, is a Python-based tool designed to extract file paths (e.g., PDFs, PPTs, DOCs) from Zotero RDF files and convert them into Markdown files using an external application, `magic-pdf`. It supports filenames with spaces and non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese characters). The tool allows users to specify temporary and output folders, ensuring an organized workflow for managing and converting academic or research documents.
